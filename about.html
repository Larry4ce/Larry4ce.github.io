		<p>Hi, my name is Larry Force, I have been working for a number of years on becoming the programmer I have always wanted to be. Don't get me wrong, I AM a programmer, but I hope to one day be that one guy who built his own Linux distro because everyone else "has it all wrong". I'm currently at the level of "Jeez, AJAX sure seems to go wrong for aparently no reason sometimes, huh?" and working my way up though.</p>
		<p>My first steps into programming was through a game design program that USED TO BE free. It was called Gamemaker, and while it lacked a creative name, it certainly didn't lack in it's very small learning curve. I was 9 years old, and I had heard about it on "Attack of The Show" on G4 (while it was still a good station) and just had to try it, unaware that would be the first step to me becoming the programmer I am now. I was making games for fun most days ()and likely have some on an old harddrive somewhere) until I reached a wall. Gamemaker allowed you to do most things with it's drag and drop system, but I wanted to make a game in 3d; which was a paid feature. So after I talked my mom into the $15 fee, I jumpe right in, only to find that it required me to learn GML. (Gamemaker language, once again, these guys were pretty straight forward with their naming conventions.) At this time, I was about 10 years old, and everyone online was going to these seminars for the language to learn it in a class setting; but I was 10 years old, and they were 20-30. I knew it would be weird if I went into these classes as a kid in the crowd, so I proceeded to learn it myself. My first experience with code took finally place as I made a game called "Escape the Minotaur's Maze." My class was reading Greek Mythology, and I thought Theseus was the best.</p>
		<p>Eventually, Gamemaker had it's limitations in it's paid form as well. The simplicity of the system created horribly inefficient final products, and my simple 3d objects were wrecking my computer with very little to offer for their hefty demands. I once again, hit a wall. I remember my final game, "Attack on Mars" pretty fondly even though it was never finished. I made it right after playing the first Halo, and all of the characters were essentially recolored Master Chiefs, fighting floating eye monsters. At that point, I took a hiatus, and eventually convinced myself I wanted to be a psychologist.</p>
		<p>Seeing as I eventually became a programmer, I have to admit, it was all thanks to a professor I had at Wells College, Bryant Adams. I talked to him over tea and cookies while I was looking at the college, and he got me interested in game design all over again, and made me realize that I had actually learned a decent skill with Gamemaker. I took his class, Programming I, and easily passed it with huge interest in continuing the path. After that class ended, Professor Adams invited me to become the Teacching Assistant for the HTML/CSS class and the Microsoft Excel class. I ran through the class and learned it all well enough to teach it in a semester, and then went on to be his assistant. I was the TA for both classes for 3 years, even after Professor Adams left the school during my first semester of Sophomore year.</p>
		<p>While Professor Adams brought me into programming, Professor Gregory Moore taught me what I needed to get hired right out of college. Professor Moore's first class I ever had with him, titled Unix/Linux, taught me how to set up a web server, link a domain name, use the Linux command line, and how to install and use Wordpress. That class is how I work at AJRoss today, and Professor Moore was a great teacher. He had this "I'm not mad, just disappointed in you" face all the time that pushed you to work extra hard, but was actually a really nice guy. It was difficult for me to talk to him like other professors though, because he was incredibly professional. He may have had a class where every week we were expected to learn a new programming language, (and we did it, somehow) but somehow nothing he asked was as impossible as we would have found it to be, had any other teacher asked it of us.</p>
		<p>These days, I find myself working for AJRoss Creative Media. The people there are fantastic, and Matt Ross is one of the best web developers I've ever met, and I'm still learning a lot from him. The graphic designers I've worked with there, TJ Knight and Carlos Vega, have been incredible as well. Up until I worked at AJRoss, I worked off of what I knew from college programming, and fun fact: programming teaches you nothing about making a website pretty.</p>

		<p>Nowadays, I work at AJRoss Creative Media. They hired me as an intern, and it turned into a paid position. I'm pretty grateful for it, since jobs are pretty impossible to get these days. The guys there are all excellent people, and I am definitely learning A LOT from Matt Ross, the head programmer.</p>
